# Pebble Commander

Pebble Commander is an app for the Pebble smartwatch that turns your Pebble into a remote control for your computer. You can use it to launch your favorite programs, or use it for automation with your own scripts.

## Backend server installation

To install the server (server.py) you will need to install the following modules:

* Flask (`pip --user install flask`)

### Configuring the backend

Configuration is done in `settings.json`. Documentation on this will be done later.

## Pebble app

The pebble app is not currently on the pebble app store at this time. In the meantime you'll have to import it into [CloudPebble](https://cloudpebble.net). I'll get the app on the app store ASAP.
